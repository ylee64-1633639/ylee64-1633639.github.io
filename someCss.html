        <p id="one">I've tried to learn some HTML and CSS on my own, 
            so that I could actually create something on my own. Needed 
            some front-end engineering knowledge, but I always learned and 
            forgot. So I'm glad I have had the chance to try to learn CSS
            and HTML again in this class :)

            Hmm I dunno what to write for the second paragraph. 
            Playing around with fonts, colors, and sizes. Here's a floating 
            picture of a cute cat.
